If your company doesn't yet use an **Internal Developer Portal (IDP)**, you may be facing problems such as:

- Lack of clarity about **who owns each service or application**
- Difficulty in **identifying security risks** in the development pipeline
- Repositories, pipelines, images and deployments **scattered without control or standards**
- **Manual** or inconsistent**audits** for LGPD, PCI, ISO and the like
- Developers overwhelmed by complex security tools

If all this sounds familiar, you're not alone. But here's the good news: **it's possible to start with the most critical pain - security - and quickly evolve to much more.**

## **Security as the gateway to your IDP**

VeeCode has launched a **Security Plugin** that could be the first step towards a new way of operating your software engineering.

This plugin is designed for companies that urgently need **visibility into vulnerabilities** in their projects - without buying expensive and complex tools like Snyk or Checkmarx.

‚û°Ô∏è And the best part: it's already **integrated with VeeCode's IDP**, allowing you to enable **governance, traceability, automations and security in one place.**

Today, many teams still operate in the dark:

- They don't know where their vulnerabilities lie
- They rely on free tools with limitations
- Use spreadsheets or scripts to try to audit risks
- It takes hours (or days) to identify a flaw in production

This scenario creates a ticking time bomb for engineering and security teams - and delays scaling and compliance initiatives.

What you need is **real, continuous and automatic visibility**.

## **What VeeCode's security plugin does (right out of the box)**

By installing the plugin, your company will be able to:

‚úÖ **Automatically scan** projects **for vulnerabilities**

‚úÖ Analyze containers and images in the CI/CD and runtime (post-deployment)

‚úÖ Receive **criticality reports and correction suggestions**

‚úÖ Monitor risks by service, repository and technical manager

‚úÖ Generate evidence for **LGPD, PCI, ISO 27001 and more**

All this **without slowing down your development team** and with integration to tools you probably already use: GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins, Argo, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes.

## **How it works in practice**

**Simple installation:** The plugin is activated in a few days by the VeeCode team together with your team - with native integration into the service catalog.

**No learning curve:** Results start to appear immediately and can be consumed by engineers, leaders or security teams.

**Expandable:** From security analysis, you can evolve to:

- Automatic service catalog
- Standardized deployment templates
- RBAC and governance by team or squad
- Customized dashboards and alerts
- Integrations with observability, SRE, performance

In other words, you start with **real, visible security**, and quickly embed your engineering in a **modern platform management** environment.

## **The difference: price that fits, results that scale**

While solutions like Snyk charge more than R$100,000 per year (and limit usage per project or developer), **VeeCode's plugin has a fixed, low cost - with automatic support, IDP integration and scalability**.
