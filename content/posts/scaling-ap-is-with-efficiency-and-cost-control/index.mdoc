Scaling a business in the financial sector requires more than just the will to grow. As banks and fintechs accelerate their digital transformation, the number of APIs multiplies — increasing risks, complexity, and especially the invisible costs of a poorly managed infrastructure.

But what if the key to scaling with control lies precisely in how you manage your APIs?

In this article, we show what changes — in practice — before and after adopting a modern API Management (APIM) platform, focusing on efficiency, security, and predictable cost.

## **A Common Scenario: Growing APIs and Manual Management as a Bottleneck**

You may have a highly skilled team, well-defined processes, and an innovation-driven culture. But without a robust management layer, it's only a matter of time before operations spiral out of control.

## **What Changes with the Adoption of a Modern APIM**

With a structured API Management platform (like the one proposed by VeeCode, for example), operations gain:

- Centralized control
- Automatic standardization
- Native scalability

## **Practical Case: A Rapidly Growing Fintech**

A fintech company partnering with VeeCode needed to prepare to meet new Open Finance partners and expand its digital product offerings.

### **Before:**

- 40 active APIs with no unified documentation
- Lack of granular access control
- 3 analysts dedicated to technical integration support

### **After APIM implementation:**

- 100+ standardized APIs with automated documentation and access control
- 80% reduction in support ticket volume
- Annual savings of R$150,000 in direct operational costs
