Imagine reducing weeks of work to just one hour. In the dynamic world of software development, process efficiency and optimization are not just desirableâ€”they're essential for success. This case study highlights the positive impact of implementing an Internal Developer Portal (IDP), leveraging VeeCode's technology, in a mid-sized software development company focused on a team working with Liferay DXP. The results showcase how productivity can be maximized and operational costs significantly reduced.

### **Current challenges**

Every new IT project requires the configuration of a development environment. Despite having company standards, setting up these environments can take one to two weeks and demand between two and five professionals. This process generates:

- **High configuration time:** Directly impacting project agility.&nbsp;&nbsp;
- **High operational costs:** Requiring senior professionals, such as Technical Leads and mid-level DevOps engineers.&nbsp;&nbsp;
- **Idle developer time:** While waiting for environment provisioning.

Without automation, requests for new environments are processed through ticketing systems, causing delays and disrupting workflows.

### **The VeeCode solution**

The adoption of VeeCode's IDP revolutionized the operational dynamics of the development team:

**1. Automated environment setup** &nbsp;

Using templates in the DevPortal, configuring a new development environment now takes less than one hour and can be initiated directly by developers without relying on other teams. Previously, this process required up to two weeks of work from a Technical Lead and a mid-level DevOps engineer.

**2. Reduced operational complexity**&nbsp;&nbsp;

Pre-configured templates, centralized APIs, and unified access to databases and clusters enabled:&nbsp;&nbsp;

- Hiring junior professionals for routine tasks.&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Redeploying specialists to more strategic projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;

**3. Elimination of idle time**&nbsp;&nbsp;

Developers no longer need to submit tickets and wait for provisioning. The waiting time was reduced from 80 hours to just one hour.

**4. Accelerated project delivery**&nbsp;&nbsp;

With the elimination of waiting periods, the team delivered tasks up to two weeks ahead of schedule.

### **Impacts and benefits**

The results achieved with VeeCode are remarkable:
