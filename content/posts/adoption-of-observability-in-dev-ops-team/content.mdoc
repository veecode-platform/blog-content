**OBSERVABILITY ADOPTION**

**Does your team know how to apply observability in your company's software?**

Observability is still a relatively new concept but it should be seen with due importance to raise awareness about its role in relation to the typical KPIs of a modern IT. Its adoption should be part of the business strategy to **improve efficiency, performance and service availability**. The observability discipline not only relates to improvements in perceived product quality, but can also positively impact operations and financial results.

Knowing the complex challenges that observability at scale presents, VeeCode Developer Platform helps you with a tool (DevPortal) that is **compatible with various existing infrastructures and is sure to meet the needs of your teams**.

Adopting observability involves understanding some basic and advanced terms related to the field. We have listed some of these **concepts for your knowledge**! Remember that as we go deeper into observability, we will find more relevant techniques to improve understanding and make the most of this practice in your company.

**Understanding and Solving Problems Effectively**

**Essential and Advanced Observability Concepts**

Observability is fundamental to "**Day 2**" in software engineering, especially when dealing with distributed systems and cloud operations. It refers to the ability to understand and explain the internal state and behavior of a system based on its collected signals.

*Charity Majors* defines observability as "understanding and explaining whatever state your system is in, no matter how strange or bizarre [...] without having to deliver more code".

Let's explore some of the basic concepts of observability:

1. **Logs:** Records of events that occur in the system. They allow you to trace the flow of execution, capture errors and record relevant information about the state of the system.\
1. **Metrics:** Quantitative measures that provide information about the performance and health of the system. They include CPU usage, memory utilization, request latency, and more.\
1. **Traces:** The ability to trace the flow of a request or transaction through different components of a distributed system. This allows you to identify bottlenecks, performance issues and understand the impact of a request on the entire system.\
1. **Alerts:** Automatic notifications triggered by specific events or conditions occurring in the system. Alerts allow operations teams to be informed quickly of potential issues or violations of critical metrics.\

- **Distributed Tracing:** In distributed systems, tracing requests that traverse multiple services can be challenging. Collecting distributed traces allows correlating trace information from different components and services, making it easier to understand the complete request flow - including even dependencies that might otherwise be unknown.\
- **Code Instrumentation:** Code instrumentation involves adding data collection points within the application code to capture relevant information at runtime. This can include capturing business metrics, additional logs, or even specific events relevant to observability.\
- **Logs and Metrics Analysis:** In addition to collecting logs and metrics, it is important to have tools and techniques to analyze and extract useful information from this data. Log and metrics analysis involves search, aggregation, visualization, and correlation techniques to identify meaningful patterns, anomalies, and trends.\
- **Event Exploitation:** Advanced observability also includes capturing and analyzing specific events that occur in the system. This can cover business events, security events, or any other type of event relevant to understanding the behavior and state of the system.\

Observability is fundamental to "**Day 2**" in software engineering, especially when dealing with distributed systems and cloud operations. It refers to the **ability to understand and explain the internal state and behavior of a system** based on its collected signals.

Recognizing that the field continues to evolve with the emergence of new technologies and practices, **VeeCode Developer Platform** strives to integrate with the leading observability solutions on the market, as well as optionally ship a **full open-source solution** as a **free alternative**, empowering your technology team to more effectively tackle complex problems without requiring a prohibitive learning curve.
