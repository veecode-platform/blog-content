Software templates have established themselves as essential tools in modern development, offering pre-configured models of source code, documents, files, and other software elements. These templates streamline the development process by providing a robust foundation, enabling developers to focus on specific project aspects without the hassle of initial setup and structuring.

In this blog post, we'll explore the benefits of software templates within the context of the VeeCode Platform. We'll discuss how these templates can accelerate development and compare the offerings of Spring Boot Initializr with VeeCode Platform's DevPortal.

### **Software Templates: Overview**

Software templates can be created by software companies, individual developers, or open-source communities. They have a wide range of applications, including:

- Creation of mobile and web applications
- Development of APIs and backend services
- Systems integration
- Software testing
- Project documentation

For software development professionals, templates are invaluable. They save time and effort, ensuring that software adheres to high standards and best practices.

### **DevPortal Tool**

The VeeCode Developer Platform's DevPortal is an open-source development portal based on Backstage. It helps accelerate software development, improve reliability, and reduce project costs by offering tools and resources to automate tasks, manage code, and set up test and production environments. Key features include:

- Software Templates
- Management Tools
- Analysis and Reporting Tools

### **Software Templates on the DevPortal of the VeeCode Platform**

Software templates play a crucial role in the development process, offering an effective way to speed up development by providing a solid project foundation. DevPortal offers standard templates and allows for the addition of customized templates, facilitating development and infrastructure tasks.

Some complex problems that templates solve include:

***\*DevOps Pipelines***

Automate tasks related to DevOps practices, such as automated testing, vulnerability analysis, continuous integration, and continuous delivery.

***\*Microservices***

Provide pre-configured code templates that include architectural and security choices, reducing the complexity of adopting microservices.

***\*Observability***

Deliver applications instrumented for distributed tracing with contextualized observability panels.

Below, we'll highlight one of our platform's standard templates.

### **Spring Boot Initializer Templates and DevPortal's SpringBoot Models**

Java remains one of the oldest, most popular, and consistent programming languages. The Spring Boot framework, notable in Java development, offers a software template via Initializr.

VeeCode Platform provides its own Spring Boot template with different features and advantages. While Spring Boot Initializr templates are generic and easy to use for quick and less complex projects, DevPortal templates aim for greater complexity and customization. They allow for the incorporation of higher-level definitions during creation, making them ideal for comprehensive and sophisticated development.

### **Advantages of DevPortal Templates Over SpringBoot Initializr**

- Configuration of internal libraries
- Basic setup for unit tests
- Database configuration (SQL, Postgres, Oracle)
- Security layer configuration (Keycloak, Okta, Oauth2)
- Dynamic credentials setup (Vault)
- Cloud configuration (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- CI/CD configuration (GitHub Actions, Gitlab CI, Jenkins)

**Final Considerations**

In conclusion, software templates are invaluable in the development process. They save time and effort, ensuring that microservices, websites, and DevOps adhere to established standards and best practices.

VeeCode Platform's DevPortal offers a variety of software templates that support development teams. While more complex and customizable than Spring Initializr, DevPortal templates bring numerous additional features and advantages.
