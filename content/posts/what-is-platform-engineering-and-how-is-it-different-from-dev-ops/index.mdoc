### Introduction

Platform Engineering is an emerging practice that is gaining more attention in the software development world. Its goal is to create and manage development platforms that provide an optimized and standardized environment for development teams to create, test, and deploy applications more efficiently. But how is this different from DevOps, which already aims to integrate development and operations to improve the delivery cycle?

### **Definition of Platform Engineering**

Platform Engineering involves offering services and tools that abstract the complexity of infrastructure and operations. These platforms serve as internal products consumed by developers and engineers, optimizing workflows, improving automation, and ensuring consistency in software delivery.

Platform Engineering teams not only integrate existing tools, such as CI/CD, monitoring, and infrastructure provisioning, but also create custom solutions that meet the specific needs of the company.

### **Difference Between Platform Engineering and DevOps**

Although DevOps and Platform Engineering have similar goals — improving software efficiency and delivery — they operate at different levels and with distinct approaches:

### **The Importance of Platform Engineering**

The importance of Platform Engineering lies in its ability to standardize and simplify processes within the organization. By creating an internal platform, the engineering team allows developers to focus on what really matters: writing code and delivering value-driven solutions for the business.

With a well-designed platform, companies can:

- **Increase Productivity:** Less time spent on setting up environments and tools means more time for feature development.
- **Reduce Human Error:** Automation and standardization provided by the platform reduce the number of errors caused by manual failures in pipelines or infrastructure.
- **Facilitate Scalability:** With a robust platform, it's easier to scale both in terms of the number of developers and the volume of applications.
- **Promote Best Engineering Practices:** By providing standardized tools and processes, the Platform Engineering team can ensure that the best security, performance, and code quality standards are followed.

### **How an Internal Developer Portal Facilitates Best Platform Engineering Practices**

An Internal Developer Portal (IDP) is a key component for adopting best Platform Engineering practices. These portals serve as a centralized interface that organizes and makes available all the services, tools, and resources developers need in an accessible and automated manner.

### **Main Benefits of an Internal Developer Portal:**

1. **Centralized Access to Tools and Services:** With an IDP, developers have access to a single dashboard where they can find all the tools they need, such as CI/CD environments, infrastructure provisioning, code templates, and more. This eliminates the need to manually search for or configure these tools.
1. **Developer Autonomy:** One of the pillars of Platform Engineering is giving developers autonomy. An Internal Developer Portal facilitates this by allowing developers to provision environments, create new services, and integrate into pipelines automatically, without relying on other teams.
1. **Automation and Standardization:** The portal automates repetitive tasks and ensures that processes follow a defined standard. This contributes to greater consistency in the development and delivery cycle, as well as reducing the chance of errors.
1. **Integration with DevSecOps Practices:** The IDP can also integrate security practices from the start of the development cycle, allowing the Platform Engineering team to implement security measures (DevSecOps) automatically in all provisioned services.
1. **Visibility and Monitoring:** An IDP provides complete visibility into what is happening in each part of the development cycle. This makes it easier to identify bottlenecks and for the Platform Engineering team to act proactively to further optimize the platform.

### **Conclusion**

While DevOps aims to improve collaboration between development and operations, Platform Engineering goes a step further by creating internal platforms that provide standardized infrastructure for developers. This movement enables greater autonomy, standardization, and efficiency in the development cycle.

By adopting an Internal Developer Portal, companies ensure that these best Platform Engineering practices are applied efficiently, delivering a smoother experience for developers and speeding up the delivery of quality software.
