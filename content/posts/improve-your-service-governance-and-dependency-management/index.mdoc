### **How an Internal Developer Portal (IDP) Helps Solve the Need for Service Governance and Dependency Management**

Service governance is one of the major challenges for development teams in modern organizations. As microservices, APIs, and distributed architectures become more widespread, the need for clear visibility into what services have been created, their dependencies, and—crucially—ownership of these services is essential for maintaining organizational efficiency. An Internal Developer Portal (IDP) plays a pivotal role in addressing these challenges, offering a centralized platform that provides not only visibility and control but also the ability to track and manage ownership across the development ecosystem.

### **The Challenge of Service Governance**

When new developers join a team, the first barrier they often encounter is a lack of clarity about what has already been created. In a dynamic and constantly evolving environment, it’s easy to get lost among dozens or even hundreds of services that, in most cases, have critical interdependencies with other teams and systems. This scenario generates several difficulties, such as:

- ***Lack of visibility of service relations and dependencies***\**:** Who depends on whom? Which services are connected to each other?
- ***Unawareness of the technologies being used:*** New team members may not know which tech stacks are already in use, leading to duplicated efforts or improper solution choices.
- ***Decentralized management:*** Leadership struggles to manage multiple teams without a unified view, impacting governance, resource allocation, and infrastructure optimization.
- ***Lack of clear communication between teams:*** Teams rely on constant communication to understand how their services connect with others, which can be inefficient and lead to errors.

These problems are particularly critical for leadership, which needs to ensure a strategic overview of operations, minimize infrastructure overload, and maximize team efficiency. This is where the[ **Internal Developer Portal**](https://docs.platform.vee.codes/) becomes a powerful solution.

### **The Solution with an Internal Developer Portal (IDP)**

An **IDP** provides a unified platform for managing services, APIs, and interdependencies between teams and systems. It acts as a centralized information hub, offering full visibility and organization of development and infrastructure operations. Below are some ways an IDP can help solve the issues mentioned earlier.

> **API Catalog**

One of the key features of an IDP is the **API catalog,** which facilitates service governance and team integration. Through this catalog, all services and APIs available in the organization are centralized and documented in one place. This allows:

- **Complete visibility:** Developers and leaders can view all the APIs and services being used and identify their dependencies with other services.
- **Clear interdependencies:** With a well-structured API catalog, it’s easy to know who is consuming which APIs and the impact of any changes or updates to a specific service.
- **Ease for new team members:** New hires can quickly identify what has already been developed and how different services connect, speeding up their onboarding process and avoiding redundant work.
- **Improve incident resolution times:** When issues arise, the IDP makes it straightforward to identify the service owner, speeding up communication and resolution.

> **Strategic View for Leadership**

For IT leaders and team managers, the IDP offers a strategic overview that simplifies decision-making. This includes:

- **Tech Radar:** The IDP can include a "tech radar" view, highlighting which technologies are in use, which are in the adoption phase, and which are being phased out. This provides leadership with a clear view of technological decisions and allows them to guide stack evolution in a more controlled way.
- **Dependency management:** The portal helps visualize dependencies between services and teams, making it easier to allocate resources and mitigate risks before they affect production.
- **Infrastructure optimization calculations:** With the visibility provided by the IDP, it’s possible to identify bottlenecks and opportunities to optimize infrastructure, whether to reduce costs or increase performance.

> **Facilitating Communication Between Teams**

Additionally, an IDP significantly improves communication between different development teams. Since all services and APIs are centralized, teams have a single source of truth to consult, preventing ambiguities and reducing the time required to understand interdependencies. The IDP also enables teams to collaborate more efficiently, sharing information about their APIs and integrating new solutions seamlessly.

### **Conclusion**

Service governance in complex development environments can be extremely challenging, but an **Internal Developer Portal** offers the ideal solution to ensure visibility, control, and efficiency across the organization. By centralizing the management of services, APIs, and their interdependencies, the IDP not only facilitates the work of developers but also gives leadership the tools necessary to optimize infrastructure, manage risks, and ensure that operations are always aligned with the company’s strategic needs.

The **API catalog** within the IDP is just one of many features that can help your team overcome governance and service management challenges. Adopting this solution can transform the way your organization operates, bringing efficiency, clarity, and control.&nbsp;
