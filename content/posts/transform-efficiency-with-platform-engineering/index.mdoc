Imagine reducing weeks of work to just one hour. In the dynamic world of software development, efficiency and process optimization are not only desirable, but indispensable for success. This case presents the positive impact of implementing an Internal Development Platform (IDP), using **VeeCode** technology, in a medium-sized company in the financial sector. The results show how it is possible to maximize productivity and significantly reduce operating costs.

### **Challenges of the Current Scenario**

Every new IT project requires the configuration of a development environment. For example, imagine starting a banking integration project with multiple APIs and external services.

This type of project requires not only the creation of containers with the main applications, but also the configuration of databases, authentication, permissions and CI/CD pipelines.

Without a standardized environment, this can take days - or even weeks - and involve several technical professionals to ensure that everything is working correctly. Although there are standards in the company, setting up these environments can take one to two weeks and require between 2 and 5 professionals. This process generates

- **Long configuration times**: This has a direct impact on the agility of the project.
- **High operating costs**: Requiring senior professionals, such as Technical Lead and full DevOps.
- **Downtime for developers**: While they wait for the environment to be provisioned.

Without automation, requests for new environments are made by opening tickets, causing delays and interruptions in the workflow.

### **Solution with VeeCode**

The adoption of **VeeCode's IDP** has transformed the operational dynamics of the development team:

### **1. Environment automation**

With the use of templates in **DevPortal**, setting up a new development environment can be done in less than **an hour**. These templates are pre-configured models that standardize the creation of environments, automatically integrating dependencies, permissions, variables and the necessary tools. In this way, the developer can start their work with just a few clicks, without relying on manual steps or intervention from other teams, and can be triggered directly by the developer, without relying on other teams. Previously, this required up to two weeks of work from a Technical Lead and a full DevOps.

### **2. Reduced operational complexity**

Pre-configured templates, centralized APIs and unified access to databases and clusters made it possible:

- Hire junior professionals for routine tasks.
- Reallocate specialists to more strategic projects.

### **3. Integrated Open Source Stack**

After a market assessment and proof of concept, the company opted to replace its current tools with an open source stack comprising:

- **VeeCode Platform** - for code security, vulnerability management and integration into the CI/CD cycle.
- **Kong Community** - a lightweight and highly extensible solution for API management, integrated with IDP.

The change provided more control and visibility over technical flows, eliminating expensive licenses and fragmented interfaces. The process was conducted in three phases: discovery and planning, a pilot with 20 projects and a complete rollout. Each stage included technical follow-up and adoption support for the teams.

### **4. Elimination of idle time**

Developers no longer have to open tickets and wait for provisioning. This has a direct impact on the daily workflow, as it eliminates bottlenecks that previously held up the start of important tasks. Instead of waiting days for responses from other teams, developers can start coding almost immediately after receiving a new request, maintaining the pace of the sprint and delivering more consistently. The reduction in waiting time has gone from **80 hours** to **1 hour**.

### **5. Agile Project Delivery**

By eliminating the waiting time, the team was able to deliver tasks up to **two weeks ahead of** schedule.

### **Impacts and benefits**

By replacing paid tools with robust open source solutions such as **VeeCode Platform** and **Kong Community**, the company has achieved:

- **An 85% reduction in annual tool licensing costs**;
- **Reduced cognitive load for engineering teams**, who now work with a unified dashboard;
- **Concrete gains in performance, security and technical governance**, with simpler and safer pipelines;
- **Greater autonomy for the teams**, with standardized flows and no need for constant intervention by specialists.

These results demonstrate how choosing well-integrated open source tools can generate savings and significantly improve the developer experience.
