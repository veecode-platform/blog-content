In today’s development landscape, Platform Engineering stands out as the natural evolution of DevOps. While DevOps prioritizes collaboration between development and operations teams, Platform Engineering goes further, fostering the creation of scalable, integrated platforms that enhance the developer experience.

#### **What is Platform Engineering?**

Platform Engineering is the practice of building a robust platform that facilitates the development, deployment, and maintenance of applications. It combines tools, practices, and automation to ensure efficiency, scalability, and consistency throughout the software lifecycle.

#### **How Does it Differ from DevOps?**

- **Scope:** DevOps focuses on collaboration and automation between development and operations; Platform Engineering encompasses a broader vision, including platform design and maintenance.
- **Tools and Practices:** While DevOps employs CI/CD practices, Platform Engineering adopts technologies like Kubernetes, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and API management (e.g., Kong Gateway) to optimize processes.
