title: How Platform Engineering Transforms Software Development in Companies
summary: >-
  Platform Engineering is revolutionizing the way companies develop software.
  This approach, which combines elements of DevOps, SRE (Site Reliability
  Engineering), and software architecture, aims to create robust and automated
  internal platforms that accelerate development, increase reliability, and
  reduce the workload of development teams.

### **What is Platform Engineering?**

Imagine an internal platform that provides developers with everything they need to quickly and efficiently create and deploy applications. This platform would manage infrastructure, services, tools, and workflows, freeing developers to focus on what really matters: creating high-quality code. This is the essence of Platform Engineering.

### **Benefits of Platform Engineering:**

1. **Acceleration of Time-to-Market:** By automating repetitive tasks and providing ready-to-use tools, Platform Engineering enables development teams to deliver software faster.
1. **Increased Reliability:** Internal platforms built on SRE principles ensure high availability, scalability, and resilience.
1. **Improved Collaboration:** By centralizing resources and information in a single platform, Platform Engineering facilitates collaboration between development, operations, and other areas of the company.
1. **Cost Reduction:** Automation and resource optimization lead to significant reductions in operational costs.
1. **Focus on Innovation:** By eliminating repetitive tasks, developers can concentrate on creating new features and innovative solutions.

### **How Does Platform Engineering Work in Practice?**

This process involves creating an internal platform that offers the following services:

- **Automatic Infrastructure Provisioning:** Developers can quickly and easily create new environments without needing to interact with infrastructure teams.
- **Service Catalog:** A centralized catalog lists all the services available on the platform, such as databases, messaging queues, APIs, etc.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Automated workflows for building, testing, and deploying software.
- **Monitoring and Alerting:** Tools to monitor system health and generate alerts in case of problems.
- **Self-Service:** Developers have the autonomy to provision resources and configure their environments.

### **Comparing with DevOps and SRE:**

Platform Engineering complements DevOps and SRE by taking automation and abstraction to a new level. While DevOps focuses on collaboration between development and operations, and SRE emphasizes system reliability, Platform Engineering provides the infrastructure and tools needed for both disciplines to function efficiently.
