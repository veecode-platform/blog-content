The rapid evolution of technology has intensified the pressure on companies to adopt more efficient ways to develop and deploy their solutions. In the financial sector, where agility and precision are paramount, the **VeeCode Platform** stands out with its **Internal Developer Portal (IDP)**, providing an innovative solution for automating application development processes with Java and Spring Boot.

### **Challenges Faced**

Before adopting VeeCode's IDP, the company encountered several common challenges in software development, including:

- **Manual and inconsistent code reviews**, leading to inefficiencies.
- **Delays in identifying and fixing errors**, especially in production environments.
- **High costs and overburdened teams**, due to repetitive tasks such as ticket management and application performance monitoring.

The lack of automation in the development process resulted in increased operational expenses and reduced team productivity.

### **Project Objectives**

The project aimed to optimize the creation and deployment of new applications, with key objectives including:

- **Reducing the time** required for developing and deploying Java applications.
- **Increasing operational efficiency** through process automation.
- **Improving code quality and consistency** with standardized templates.
- **Facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).**

These objectives aligned with the organization's goals to enhance application performance and reduce operational costs.

### **Implemented Solution: Automated Templates and IDP Integration**

The VeeCode solution introduced **automated templates** for project generation, enabling a seamless **self-service journey**. The IDP streamlined tasks such as:

- Generating and publishing **Docker images** and **Kubernetes files**.
- Directing deployments to **ArgoCD** for improved process automation.

This automation not only accelerated development but also enhanced code quality by minimizing inconsistencies.

Additionally, the **cataloging and monitoring processes** were optimized. Using **OpenAPI files**, the solution published resources in the DevPortal catalog, facilitating the creation of dashboards with **metrics, logs, and tracing**. These dashboards provided clear and precise visibility into application performance.

**Cluster management** was simplified through **Kong Gateway**, which took charge of the ingress controller and updates, ensuring robust and scalable infrastructure management.

### **Results Achieved**

The implementation delivered outstanding results, including significant cost reductions and operational efficiency gains:

- **Development**: Automating routines led to a **95% reduction in team costs** by eliminating ticket-opening tasks, previously a time-intensive process.
- **Observability**: Automated monitoring systems reduced **team costs by over 80%** for application performance tracking.

Furthermore, the solution achieved an impressive **205% ROI in the first year**, underscoring its positive impact on the company's cost-effectiveness.

### **Conclusion**

The adoption of the **VeeCode Internal Developer Portal**, combined with template automation and continuous integration, transformed how the company develops and manages applications. By eliminating manual processes and improving code visibility and consistency, the organization reduced costs, enhanced operational efficiency, and achieved substantial financial returns.

This case highlights the power of automation and integration tools for companies seeking to thrive in a competitive and dynamic market. By embracing innovative solutions like VeeCode's IDP, organizations can accelerate their digital transformation and reach new levels of performance and success.
