**Introduction**

In today's complex IT landscape, understanding and solving system problems requires more than traditional monitoring. Observability, which focuses on real-time data analysis of metrics, logs, and traces, is crucial for gaining insights into system behavior. Unlike conventional monitoring, which emphasizes predefined metrics, observability offers a comprehensive view, enabling early problem detection and resolution.

### **Understanding Observability vs. Monitoring**

While often used interchangeably, observability and monitoring are distinct concepts:

- **Monitoring:** Involves collecting and analyzing performance data, including metrics, logs, and events. It helps identify performance, availability, and security issues, triggering alerts for remedial action.
- **Observability:** Goes deeper by enabling real-time understanding of a system's internal state from its monitoring data. It helps identify root causes of problems, allowing teams to respond swiftly.

Typically, monitoring is handled by Operations teams, while observability is the domain of Product and Development teams. This shift breaks down traditional IT barriers, empowering the most qualified teams to address issues, thereby reducing the frequency and impact of incidents.
