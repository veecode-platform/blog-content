### Introduction

Backstage, developed by Spotify, is a popular tool for creating internal developer platforms (IDPs). However, **VeeCode's IDP** goes far beyond in terms of functionality and practicality.

While Backstage requires significant customization and dedicated teams to set up and maintain the platform, VeeCode delivers a ready-made, comprehensive, and scalable solution. VeeCode's focus is on **simplifying the management** of microservices, infrastructure, and DevOps operations, allowing teams to concentrate on what truly matters: ***innovation and delivering value***.

### **Key Differences:**

- **Quick and simplified installation:** VeeCode offers a ready-to-use IDP platform, with native integration with cloud providers and DevOps tools. There’s no need to spend months developing a customized solution as would be required with Backstage.
- **Support and updates:** Maintaining a platform like Backstage requires expertise and time, whereas VeeCode provides continuous support and automatic updates, ensuring your infrastructure is always up-to-date without team intervention.
- **Pipeline automation:** VeeCode simplifies the automation of CI/CD pipelines, while Backstage offers less immediate support for sophisticated workflows without additional customizations. With VeeCode, pipelines are pre-configured, reducing deployment time.
- **Security and governance:** VeeCode also stands out with direct integration of security and governance policies, ensuring compliance and access control intuitively, whereas Backstage requires deeper customization.

With **VeeCode’s IDP**, companies can adopt a robust and highly scalable platform without the burden of building and maintaining a complex infrastructure like **Backstage**. VeeCode enables teams to focus on delivering innovation, with full support and modern IDP functionalities.
