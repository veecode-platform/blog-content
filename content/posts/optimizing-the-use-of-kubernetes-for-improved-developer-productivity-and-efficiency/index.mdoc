### **Understanding Kubernetes**

Kubernetes orchestrates containerized applications, offering a platform to run, scale, and manage applications across machine clusters. Key features include:

- **Efficient Scaling:** Kubernetes scales applications horizontally by adding nodes to the cluster, either automatically or manually.
- **Reliable Availability:** It ensures applications remain available by relocating pods to healthy nodes if failures occur.
- **Automated Management:** Automates tasks such as deployment, updates, and monitoring.

Despite its advantages, deploying and operating Kubernetes is complex. Managed Kubernetes services (Amazon EKS, Google GKE, Azure AKS) simplify this but still require specialized teams for large-scale operations. Therefore, Kubernetes is often not the ideal abstraction level for day-to-day development.
