For many years, security was something that happened afterwards.

After the code was ready.

After deployment in production.

And, unfortunately, sometimes only after the incident.

But in a world where software engineering is increasingly distributed, accelerated and sensitive to regulatory and reputational risks, this approach needs to change.

And it has already started to change - with the new generation of platforms designed for and by developers.

‚ú≥Ô∏è The Internal Developer Portal as the core of modern engineering

Internal Developer Portals (IDPs) are consolidating as the operational center of engineering platforms.

They unify:

- Microservices catalog
- Pipelines and infrastructure as code
- Governance by squad
- Standardized deployment templates

And now... security as a native layer.

### üöÄ Security by default: more than a trend, a necessity

At VeeCode, we believe that security should not happen in silos, nor should it be delegated to isolated and expensive tools that only increase the complexity of the pipeline.

That's why we created the Security Plugin as an extension to our IDP.

And we're seeing it transform the way our customers operate:

‚úÖ Vulnerabilities visible right in the service catalog

‚úÖAutomated scans covering CI to post-deployment

‚úÖRBAC and reports that eliminate audit rework

‚úÖ Replacing multiple paid tools with a single native solution

üí° The vision we're building (with you)\
That's just the beginning.

Our security roadmap is guided by those who are living the real challenges of modern engineering. And we want you to be part of it.\

**The VeeCode IDP + Security Plugin is your new starting point.**

And it's also the future your team has been waiting for - accessible, integrated, automated and with real support to evolve with you.

‚úä Help shape the next generation of security at Dev Portals

We're building a community of early adopters, technical leaders and visionary engineers willing to redefine security without compromising productivity.
