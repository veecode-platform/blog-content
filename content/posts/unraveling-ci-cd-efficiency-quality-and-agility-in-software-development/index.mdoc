### **Introduction**

DevOps combines practices, cultural changes, and tools to enhance software production, leading to more frequent and higher quality deliveries. It aims to automate repetitive tasks in building, testing, and delivering software, improving reliability while reducing operational costs and risks. Central to DevOps are continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), which automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code.

### **Benefits of Adopting CI/CD**

1. **Improved Code Quality:** Automating repetitive tasks, such as running tests, ensures better quality code.
1. **Reduced Costs:** Early detection and resolution of issues save developers time and reduce costs.
1. **Improved Reliability:** CI/CD tracks improve system reliability, making their behavior predictable.
1. **Increased Delivery Frequency:** Frequent software releases speed up the delivery of new features and security updates.
1. **Enhanced Security:** CI/CD pipelines conduct vulnerability tests, reducing exposure to cyber attacks.
